## **How It Works**

### **Task Flow:**
1. **Task Submission**:
   - User submits a task via the frontend **Control Panel**.
   - The task is sent to the **Claude Intake Agent** through the FastAPI backend.

2. **Claude 3.5 Intake**:
   - **Claude 3.5** performs initial reasoning and splits the task into subtasks.
   - The task and subtasks are vectorized for efficient retrieval.

3. **ChatGPT Aggregation**:
   - **ChatGPT 4.0** agents handle intermediate processing, aggregation, and summarization.
   - Each agent is aware of the full task context via vectorized data storage, allowing them to work in sync.

4. **Claude 3.5 Output**:
   - After intermediate processing, **Claude 3.5** retrieves the vectorized data, performs final reasoning, and generates the final response.
   - The result is delivered back to the user via the **Dashboard** interface.

- **Task**: Intermediate processing of subtasks, aggregating information while being aware of the entire task context.
- **Logic**:
  - Retrieves subtasks from vectorized storage.
  - Works asynchronously to process and aggregate data efficiently.
  - Vectorizes the processed results for Claude to retrieve.

### **Claude Output Agent** (`claude_output.py`)
- **Task**: Final task execution and reasoning, consolidating the results from ChatGPT agents and delivering the final output.
- **Logic**:
  - Retrieves intermediate results from the vectorized data.
  - Applies high-level reasoning and delivers the final output.

## **Use Cases**

1. **Complex Task Management**:
   - Users can submit complex tasks that require multiple steps of processing. Claude 3.5 splits the task, ChatGPT agents handle intermediate steps, and Claude finalizes the result.

2. **Data Aggregation and Summarization**:
   - Tasks requiring aggregation from multiple sources (e.g., research summaries) can be processed by ChatGPT agents, with Claude providing the final structured output.

3. **Real-time Task Monitoring**:
   - Users can monitor task progress in real-time via the dashboard, seeing how each agent interacts with the task and how close it is to completion.

4. **Cost-effective Data Handling**:
   - Vectorized storage ensures that similar tasks are handled more efficiently, reducing the need for repetitive API calls and lowering costs.

---

## **Best Practices**

### **1. Async Task Processing**:
- Use asynchronous processing to ensure that agents can handle tasks concurrently, improving overall speed.
- Task queues (e.g., Redis, Celery) help synchronize the asynchronous processing when needed.

### **2. Vectorized Data Handling**:
- **Claude** and **ChatGPT** agents work with vectorized data to reduce storage and retrieval times.
- Vectorization ensures that even large prompts or tasks can be stored efficiently, reducing costs and latency.

### **3. Modular and Scalable Architecture**:
- The architecture allows easy addition of new agents or tasks.
- Agents are modular, meaning they can be extended with new capabilities without impacting the entire system.

### **4. Error Handling and Logging**:
- Implement robust error handling for API interactions.
- Use logging to monitor agent activity, task progress, and system health.

### **5. Cache Frequently Used Data**:
- Use Redis or another caching system to store frequently queried vectorized data, reducing API calls to **Claude** and **ChatGPT**.

GUIDE


### **1. Overview of the System Architecture**

We are building a **multi-agent swarm-based system** inside a **React + Vite** framework, leveraging **Claude 3.5** and **ChatGPT 4.0** agents for distributed task processing. This system will efficiently handle vectorized data, focusing on speed, resource optimization, and scalability. It includes a fully functional **interface, dashboard, and control panel** accessible from a landing page. The swarm agents operate asynchronously, yet are synchronized by logic to deliver smart, fast, and cost-effective results.

### **2. Technology Stack**

  - **React**: Component-based UI framework for building the control panel, dashboard, and task interface.
  - **Vite**: Fast, modern build tool for the React application.
  
- **Backend:**
  - **FastAPI**: RESTful API for communication between agents and the front-end.
  
- **Agents:**
  - **Claude 3.5** (via API): For handling initial data intake and final result processing.
  - **ChatGPT 4.0** (via API): Aggregation agents for intermediate processing.
  
- **Data Handling:**
  - **Vectorized Data**: Use vectorization libraries (e.g., **FAISS**, **ScaNN**) for efficient storage and retrieval of prompt content.

- **System Orchestration**:
  - **GPT-Swarm**: Framework for multi-agent task distribution and interaction between Claude and ChatGPT agents.

#### **Recommended Additions:**
- **Vector Database**: Consider using **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** for scalable, vector-based data retrieval.
- **Task Queue**: Use **Redis** or **Celery** to manage and synchronize async task queues between agents.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Implement **Prometheus** for tracking API usage, performance, and agent health.
- **Cache**: **Redis** for caching frequently queried or processed data to reduce API calls and costs.
  
### **3. Detailed Guide for System Setup**

#### **Step 1: Initialize the React + Vite Application**
Set up the base React + Vite project for the frontend, which will include the dashboard, control panel, and agent status display.

1. Create the Vite project:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest swarm-app --template react
   cd swarm-app
   npm install
   ```

2. Install necessary dependencies for routing and state management (for the dashboard and control panel):
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom redux
   ```

3. Add a **landing page** with a menu linking to different parts of the control panel (e.g., "Dashboard", "Task Submission", "Agent Management").

#### **Step 2: Set Up Backend with FastAPI**
Set up a **FastAPI** backend to handle API requests and orchestrate tasks between agents.

1. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. Create an API endpoint to submit tasks:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.post("/submit-task/")
   async def submit_task(task: dict):
       # Logic to send task to Claude 3.5 for initial intake
       return {"status": "Task submitted successfully!"}
   ```

3. Create endpoints for task monitoring and agent status.

#### **Step 3: Implement GPT-Swarm and Vectorized Data Storage**
1. **GPT-Swarm Installation**:
   - Clone and configure GPT-Swarm from the GitHub repo in the appropriate backend folder.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Open-Swarm-Net/GPT-Swarm.git
     cd GPT-Swarm
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Vectorization**:
   - Use **FAISS** or **ScaNN** to vectorize the prompt data as soon as it's ingested by Claude 3.5.
   - Each incoming task will be vectorized and stored in the vector database for efficient retrieval during intermediate and final stages.

   Example:
   ```python
   from faiss import IndexFlatL2

   # Example of vectorizing prompt content
   def vectorize_prompt(prompt_text):
       vector = some_vectorization_function(prompt_text)
       index.add(vector)
   ```

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Claude 3.5 does the initial vectorization and passes the task to intermediate ChatGPT agents.
   - The task is processed, and intermediate results are stored in vector format for quick retrieval by downstream agents (especially for aggregation).
   - Finally, Claude 3.5 retrieves all relevant data (via vector search) for final processing and generates the polished output.

#### **Step 4: Smart Agent Communication**
1. **Claude 3.5 Intake Agent**:
   - Claude 3.5 ingests the initial task and vectorizes it for future reference. It also decides how to split the task into subtasks for the **ChatGPT aggregation agents**.

2. **ChatGPT Aggregation Agents**:
   - These agents work on subtasks, continuously aware of the full task context (via vectorized prompt storage). They interact asynchronously but follow a logical, synchronized workflow.

   **Best Practice**: Agents should communicate via a shared task queue (e.g., Redis or Celery) to ensure real-time task handoffs, with task state tracking to avoid duplication or missed steps.

3. **Claude 3.5 Output Agent**:
   - Claude performs a final vector-based data retrieval, aggregates all outputs, and performs a reasoning pass for the final user-facing response.

#### **Step 5: Building the Dashboard**
1. **User Control Panel**:
   - Build a control panel in React that allows users to:
     - Submit tasks.
     - Monitor agent activity and performance.
     - Visualize task status in real-time.
     - View logs of completed tasks and results.

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Use **WebSockets** or **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** for real-time updates on task progress and agent interactions.

#### **Step 6: Implementing Best Practices**
1. **Async Task Processing**:
   - Ensure all agents operate asynchronously to improve speed. Use task queues to synchronize processes where necessary, without introducing delays.

2. **Optimized Vector Storage**:
   - Keep vectors as small as possible by carefully choosing the right dimensionality. Efficient vector indexing ensures that tasks can be retrieved and processed quickly.

3. **Agent Logic**:
   - Use logic trees or decision-making systems to optimize which agents handle which tasks. Claude 3.5 should focus on high-level reasoning, while ChatGPT 4.0 handles aggregation tasks.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement retries, logging, and monitoring to ensure smooth task execution. Log errors at every stage and provide fallbacks for failure cases.

### **Conclusion**
This guide outlines how to set up the entire system, from the technical stack to the flow of agents and task handling. It emphasizes scalability, efficiency, and smart agent communication. The use of vectorized data for every stage of task processing ensures quick retrieval and seamless transitions between agents, making the system fast and cost-effective.
